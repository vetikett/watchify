A fun project where a user will be match with other users.
So, the idea is: Instead of searching for movies to watch based on titles you probably would like, you will be matched with users and their entire "quality marked" library of movies that they like.

This way you will get match with titles that represents your entire "taste" instead of matching towards isolated attributes such as: genre, titel and so on.

We'll see if its a good idea or not...
